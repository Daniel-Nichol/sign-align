This project explores a novel way to combine Hidden Markov Models to build a sign classifier capable of distinguishing between a dictionary of 20 signs of British Sign Language. This classifier can be used to detect signs made in real time with high accuracy and constitutes an important first step towards a full translation system for BSL. In this report we introduce the theory of Hidden Markov Models and show how we implemented and combined these models to build a trainable classifier. We go on to show how we used a Microsoft Kinect sensor to collect sets of training and test data which were used to determine optimal parameterisations of the classifier. The result is a sign classifier which is able to detect signs performed in real-time and which has an accuracy of over 90\%. Such an accuracy measure is on par with other sign recognition systems despite the fact that the classifier developed here uses no information about the shape of the signer's hand.
